# AI-Powered Terraform Module for GitHub Repository Standardization and Prompt Tracking

## **Overview**
This document outlines the design for a Terraform module that generates standardized GitHub repositories with AI-generated content and tracks modifications to prompt files over time. The module ensures consistency across projects while providing AI-powered guidance for developers. It also integrates with external storage (AWS S3/DynamoDB and GCP Storage/Firestore) to track prompt file changes for future refinements. 

## **Key Benefits**
1. **Automated Repository Setup** - Standardized repository structure with AI-generated documentation, ensuring uniformity across projects.
2. **Seamless Developer Experience** - Provides developers with pre-configured prompts and workspace settings tailored to their repository topics and project requirements.
3. **Multi-Cloud External Storage** - Supports AWS and GCP as external storage options for tracking prompt changes over time, allowing for flexibility and adaptability to different cloud environments.
4. **AI-Driven Learning** - Captures and analyzes modifications to AI-generated prompt files, enabling refinements based on user interactions and preferences.
5. **GitHub Free Tier Compatible** - Designed to operate without requiring GitHub Pro features, making it accessible to all users and organizations.

## **Design Principles**
1. **Minimal Developer Input** - Focuses on generating maximum value with minimal manual configuration, reducing onboarding time and operational overhead.
2. **Topic and Prompt-Based Generation** - Uses repository topics to guide structural decisions and prompt-based inputs to tailor AI-generated documentation and configurations.
3. **External Storage for AI Learning** - Implements a cloud-based mechanism to store and analyze changes to AI-generated prompt files, facilitating iterative improvements in prompt quality.
4. **Opt-In Learning** - Ensures user privacy by allowing developers to disable tracking of prompt modifications if they prefer not to participate in AI-driven refinements.

## **Implementation Components**

### **1. Terraform Module for Repository Standardization**
#### **Base Repository Structure**
The Terraform module is responsible for creating standardized repository files, ensuring that all projects maintain a uniform structure. These files include project configuration settings, team ownership definitions, and AI-generated documentation that aligns with the project's topics and scope.

The module relies on input variables to define essential repository attributes, such as the project name, organization, repository topics, and high-level project prompt. These inputs drive AI-generated content to ensure relevance and consistency across multiple repositories.

### **2. AI-Generated Prompt File Tracking**
To enable continuous learning and refinement of AI-generated prompt files, the module tracks modifications using external storage solutions.

#### **Storage Backend Options**
- **AWS**: Uses S3 for storing prompt file versions and DynamoDB for structured metadata tracking, allowing for easy retrieval and comparison of changes.
- **GCP**: Implements Cloud Storage for file storage and Firestore for metadata tracking, ensuring that prompt modifications are efficiently stored and queried.

#### **Storage Selection and Configuration**
Developers can configure their preferred cloud storage provider based on their organization's infrastructure requirements. The Terraform module dynamically provisions the necessary cloud resources, ensuring a seamless setup process.

AWS-based storage utilizes S3 versioning to retain historical changes, while GCP-based storage employs Cloud Storage's versioning mechanism alongside Firestore for metadata tracking.

#### **User Opt-Out Mechanism**
To accommodate privacy concerns, developers can disable prompt file tracking through a configurable variable. When tracking is disabled, no data is stored in external storage, and AI-driven refinements are not applied.

### **3. Python Script Integration with OpenAI for Prompt Refinements**
As an initial approach, AI-generated prompts will be processed using a Python script, wrapped within Terraform using `null_resource` and `external` data sources. This approach provides flexibility in integrating AI-generated content without requiring an immediate Terraform provider implementation.

The Python script dynamically generates prompts based on project metadata, repository topics, and predefined best practices. Terraform retrieves and applies the AI-generated content, ensuring that repositories contain relevant and structured documentation.

This method allows for real-time prompt refinements while maintaining Terraform's declarative approach. As the project matures, transitioning to a dedicated Terraform provider may be considered for improved efficiency and maintainability.

### **Next Steps**
- Develop and deploy the Terraform module for automating GitHub repository setup with AI-generated content.
- Implement external storage tracking mechanisms for AWS and GCP, ensuring robust data retention and retrieval capabilities.
- Finalize and optimize the Python script for AI-powered prompt generation, ensuring seamless integration with Terraform.
- Monitor user feedback and iterate on AI-driven refinements to improve prompt quality and repository documentation over time.
