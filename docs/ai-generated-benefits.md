# Benefits of AI-Generated Development Environment

## Overview
This project creates a standardized development environment pre-configured with documentation, code references, and prompt guidance. It's designed to help developers quickly begin work with minimal setup, especially benefiting those with less experience in the project's technology stack.

## Key Benefits
1. **Consistency** - All repositories maintain uniform structure and configuration
2. **Efficiency** - Reduces manual setup work by automating repository configuration
3. **Standardization** - Provides identical development environments across a team
4. **Guided Development** - Built-in prompts and documentation help developers stay on track
5. **Works with Free GitHub** - All features operate with public repositories and standard GitHub features

## How It Works
The module uses a combination of:
- Repository topics to determine technical needs
- Project prompts to understand business requirements
- Repository-specific prompts for implementation details

These inputs automatically generate appropriate:
- Base repository files (.gproj, CODEOWNERS, README.md)
- Documentation references based on technology stack
- VS Code workspace settings and extension recommendations
- Developer guidance via embedded prompts

## Required Setup
To use this module effectively, you must specify:
- `project_prompt`: High-level description of project purpose
- `repo_org`: GitHub organization name  
- `project_name`: Base name for project repositories

## Implementation Notes
1. All functionality works with standard GitHub features (no Pro required)
2. Keep repository topics focused and accurate
3. Run `terraform fmt` after making any changes
4. Test all changes with public repositories first

## End Result
Developers can open VS Code into the workspace and immediately begin working with GitHub Copilot. The pre-configured environment provides contextual documentation and prompts that guide developers toward building the right solution without requiring extensive background knowledge.
